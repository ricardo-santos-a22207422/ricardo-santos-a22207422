## Current Status
Currently I am in my third year with few projects to share but enough knowledge to start my own stuff during my free time.
I am developing a website for a Uni project, and learning some Unreal Engine 5 skills for the time being.

## Interests
A huge VR enthusiast who's always looking to learn anything I can in the field.
I'd love to develop VR software and hardware (if I get there) to help make VR reach more people.

Gaming and anime lover, caffeine addict and huge motorcycle enjoyer.
